We’re thrilled to announce that the website is almost complete! We’re so grateful for everyone who supported us through donations, and we hope you’ll enjoy the stable release once it’s ready.

This project started just 12 days ago, and it’s been an honor to have your support along the way. The legacy website (https\://www\.sites.google.com/view/enclaveos) will be redirected to the new one, as the old site will be replaced. Thank you again for your support!
