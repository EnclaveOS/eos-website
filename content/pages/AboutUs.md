      We are the Enclave Team, creators of EnclaveOS and EnclaveUX. As
      developers and photographers, our mission is to design refined custom ROMs
      featuring a visually stunning and smooth user interface. Our passion for
      photography extends to crafting unique wallpapers, enhancing the overall
      beauty and appeal of our work. However, expanding support for more devices
      remains challenging due to limited equipment. You can assist us by
      [donating](/Donate), or alternatively, by applying through the [UX
      Development Application](/UXDevApp) to help us expand support for more
      devices.
