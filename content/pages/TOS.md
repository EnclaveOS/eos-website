          Please ensure you thoroughly review the Terms and Conditions before
          submitting applications or joining our channels.


          1.  Submitting false information on applications is strictly
          prohibited. All submissions are carefully reviewed, and failure to
          provide accurate details may result in severe and irreversible
          consequences.


          *    2\. Applicants must be at least 13 years old and must have
          parental permission to apply and join our community. If it is
          discovered that an applicant is underage, they will be banned, and all
          applications from minors will be rejected.


          *


          *    3\. Prank calls are strictly forbidden. Any prank callers will be
          blocked for a week. Please do not waste our time, as we have zero
          tolerance for such behavior.


          *


          *    4\. EnclaveOS is specifically optimized for select devices;
          flashing it on unsupported hardware may result in a voided warranty or
          a bricked device.


          *

           5\. We hold no liability or responsibility for bricked devices, corrupted partitions, or bootloops caused by device modifications.
