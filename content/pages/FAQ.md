        title: Will This Brick My Phone?
        subtitle: As Long As You Read Carefully
        text: >
          You won't risk bricking your phone if you carefully read and follow
          the instructions. Under no circumstances should you follow any
          guidelines from social media, as they may be fake or outdated.

        title: Why Can't I Find My Device In The List?
        subtitle: It May Not Be Supported
        text: >
          If you cannot locate your device, it may be unsupported or not yet
          developed. Always double-check the Devices tab before reaching out to
          us. Unofficial builds of our custom ROM might be available for your
          device on XDA, but they could have bugs, so proceed with caution.

        title: How Can I Support A Device
        subtitle: With The UX Development Application
        text: >
          You can support your device officially, but always make sure to listen
          carefully to the person. Once it's ready, we will add it to our list,
          release it on XDA, and credit you in the [credits](/cred) tab
          (Developers).
